# About This Project
This was a fun little 2D game about fighting. I saw someone make something similar to this, so I wanted to try my hand at it too. I worked on this in 2022 for a few months. Most of my focus in this project went straight into making the AI, which came out with something I found to probably be the most fun of my projects to play.

# Highlights
* Combat: The combat was 2D based, you could swing a weapon which casted an arc of damage in the direction of your mouse.
* AI Controls: The AI here was very advanced for where I started. Essentially they weigh control variables to make decisions on what range they should be from a target, which direction to strafe, whether to attack with an enemy or separately to allow the play to react, and whether to chase or move away from the target.

# Insight On Drawbacks and Issues
There were some issues that lead to incorrect movement that never got fixed. This was a time before I knew about automated testing, so this lead to fringe cases failing and giving incorrect movement for the AI.

# Final Comments
This project was definitely the most fun to play by the end. I wish I knew about testing before I had started, so I could have saved several hours debugging to find mathematical errors in the decision weighing code.
